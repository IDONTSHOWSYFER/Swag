🌐 What is SWAG?

SWAG is a modern, fashion-inspired, React-powered web application built during an intensive 5-day React Hackathon Learning Lab (CODA x SPARKA).
The mission:

Build a fully functional, well-architected, visually iconic React application as a real dev team.

Our project simulates a streetwear marketplace + news experience, including:
	•	🛒 Marketplace with real item filtering, pagination & dynamic modals
	•	🧢 3D-inspired product cards with interactive UI
	•	📰 News Hub with dynamic routing and article detail pages
	•	📨 Contact / Support panel with email & call actions
	•	👤 User Profile & Cart pages
	•	⚙️ Global routing, scroll-to-top behavior & responsive layout

All wrapped in a clean, modern, cyber-streetwear aesthetic.

If you want, I can also generate:

✅ A TEAM section (with roles, avatars, jokes)

Just tell me — I’ll make it iconic.
